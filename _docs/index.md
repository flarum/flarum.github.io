Flarum is a free, open-source forum software with a focus on simplicity. You can use Flarum to easily [set up a discussion forum]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/installation) for your website.

Flarum is developed openly on [GitHub](https://github.com/flarum/flarum).

## Goals

Flarum is the combined successor of [esoTalk](http://esotalk.org) and [FluxBB](http://fluxbb.org). It aims to be:

- **Fast and simple.** No clutter, no bloat, no complex dependencies. Flarum is built with PHP, so it's quick and easy to deploy. The interface is powered by [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org), a performant JavaScript framework with a tiny footprint.

- **Beautiful and responsive.** This is forum software for humans. Flarum is carefully designed to be consistent and intuitive across platforms, out-of-the-box. It's backed by LESS, so theming is a cinch.

- **Powerful and extensible.** Customize, extend, and integrate Flarum to suit your community. Flarum's architecture is amazingly flexible, prioritizing comprehensive APIs and great documentation.

- **Free and open.** Flarum is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/flarum/flarum/blob/master/LICENSE) and being worked openly on [GitHub](https://github.com/flarum/flarum).

## Installation

> **Flarum is currently in beta and should not be used in production.** It is being developed openly on GitHub. Check out the [Roadmap](http://flarum.org/roadmap) to follow along with our progress.

To give Flarum a spin, go to the [Installation](http://flarum.org/docs/installation) page. You'll need a server with **PHP 5.5+** and **MySQL 5.5+**.
