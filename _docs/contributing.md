## Reporting Bugs

Thank you for helping us test Flarum. We're happy to have you on the team! We need people who can *troubleshoot issues patiently* and *communicate them clearly*. As you probably know, good bug reporting takes some time and effort. If you're fine with that, then let's get started!

Found a bug already? Wonderful! We'd love to hear about it &mdash; but first you should check around to make sure you're not wasting your time on a known issue:

- Search our [Support forum](http://discuss.flarum.org/t/support) to see if it's already been reported.
- We could be working on a fix, so search our [issue tracker](https://github.com/flarum/core/issues) too.

If you've searched *thoroughly* and come up empty-handed, we'll welcome your report. If it's just a simple issue (a misspelled word or graphics glitch, for example) skip to the next paragraph. But if you're seeing errors, or something is clearly broken, we'll need you to gather some information first. Please head over to our [Troubleshooting](http://flarum.org/docs/troubleshooting/) guide and follow the instructions there. Collect as much info as you can!

Okay, time to get writing. Head back to the [Support forum](http://discuss.flarum.org/t/support) and start a new discussion. Be sure to give it a title that's clear and concise, and then explain the problem thoroughly. Don't forget to mention:

- What you were doing when the problem occurred
- All the information you gathered while troubleshooting
- Anything you can tell us about your server environment

Remember: the goal of a bug report is to make it easy for us to replicate the bug and fix it. You might want to read [this article](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html) for some useful tips on how to write an effective bug report. And please take a moment or two to format your post so it's easy to tell what's what.

Once you've posted your report, we'd ask that you please *follow the discussion* that you created and wait patiently. We may need to ask for further details or clarification; but we've always got plenty to do, and it could be a while before we can give your report the time it deserves.
