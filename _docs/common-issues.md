## Upload avatar error (nginx webserver)

Often people find error when try to upload avatar image file. there are 4 check points you want to double check:
1. avatar file size MUST < 2M, (this looks like Flarum hardcoded limit)
2. double check `nginx.conf: client_max_body_size 2m;` (if your nginx cfg file don't have this line, [default is 1M](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size))
3. double check `php.ini: upload_max_filesize = 2M`, change to at least 2M to comply with Flarum number
4. install `php-imagick` pkg for your php installation. 
If all 4 check points all correct and you still got error. change `flarum/config.php: 'debug' => true,,`, reproduce the issue, and click the "*debug*" link of the error prompt, hopefully the debug message will give you clue of what's going on.


## Package http-interop/http-middleware is abandoned

This is a warning and you can safely ignore it. The dependency will be fixed in a future version.

## Internal Server Error / Permission denied

Flarum needs permission to write files (cache, avatars). You may get error messages if your folders are not writeable by the PHP user. 


**Solution A**

First, find out which user PHP is running under (usually `www-data`):

```raw
ps uxa | grep php-fpm
```

Then, as `root`, change the ownership to this user:

```raw
chown -R www-data:www-data assets storage/*
```


**Solution B**

If you use shared hosting, an alternative solution is to change the file permissions:

```raw
chmod 777 assets assets/* storage/*
```

## "Something went wrong while trying to load the full version of this site"

A bug in Flarum causes the asset files to not regenerate properly. It happens when you enable specific extensions. This will be fixed in Flarum in a future version. For now, you solve it by running in a shell:

```raw
php flarum cache:clear
rm assets/rev-manifest.json
```

And force-reload the page in your browser (e.g. `ctrl-shift-R`). NB. this is only required when you enable extensions. Your forum visitors will not notice it. 

## Icons are squares

This happens when your configured URL differs from the one you are using right now. Check whether the URL in `config.php` is the same. Also check for a possible `http` <> `https` mismatch.

## Slow

There could be various reasons why your Flarum feels slow. A normal page load should happen in under 1 second (check in your browsers developer tools).

To find the root cause, first identify which component is slow. Run `top` on your server. It will show you the processes that use the most capacity. Possibilities:

**Nginx or Apache**

The webserver is busy. This should not happen, unless you use `mod_php` but that is not recommended.

**MySQL**

Your database is busy. Use a tool like `mytop` to identify slow queries. You could also enable the slow query log (`mysql -u root -e 'SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = "ON";'`) if you are the server admin. Then, all the queries that take unusually long will get logged. This might show extensions that are not optimized for large databases (missing indexes). 

**PHP-FPM**

Flarum is busy producing a page. Enable PHP-FPM's slow query feature to identify slow functions or extensions. Add this to your pool config file:

```
slowlog = /var/log/php-fpm-slow.log
request_slowlog_timeout = 3s
```

It will save a stack trace for every request that takes more than 3 seconds.
